Ringo found a string s of length n in his yellow submarine. The string contains only lowercase letters from the English alphabet. As Ringo and his friends love palindromes, he would like to turn the string s into a palindrome by applying two types of operations to the string.

The first operation allows him to choose i (2≤i≤n−1) and to append the substring s2s3…si (i−1 characters) reversed to the front of s.

The second operation allows him to choose i (2≤i≤n−1) and to append the substring sisi+1…sn−1 (n−i characters) rever
